#### Personal Project \#1

Here is a personal project that I did one day because I was bored. 
This is an animation showing the process of finding the line of best fit for a least squares linear regression. The code used to generate this graphic and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/kmfunde/kmfunde.github.io/tree/e16be00cd0d969b659560c1f3d795799e5cb6f0b/projects/examples).
