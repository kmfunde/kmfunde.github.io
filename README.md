## Projects
I have done many things, but here are a select few.


### Personal Project \#1

Here is a personal project that I did one day because I was bored. 
This is an animation showing the process of finding the line of best fit for a least squares linear regression. The code used to generate this graphic and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/kmfunde/DS-projects/tree/194bda069e9c8220c159d71c3114e7df4835abf9/example-project).

### Time-Series Analysis of Personal Income Trends in Maryland

This is another thing I did because I was bored. More details and the code used can be found [here.](https://github.com/kmfunde/DS-projects/tree/dc04f76d3725581ef968782216a24770d510e078/personal-income)
