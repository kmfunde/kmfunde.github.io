This is a project looking at changes in personal income over time. Specifically, I was interested seeing how the percentage breakdown of personal income by county compared to the percentage of the population. Put more simply, does each county's percentage of the population equal their share of the personal income for the state? And has that stayed consistent over time?

Data was collected from the 2023 data release of Personal Income by County and Metropolitan Area from the Burea of Economic Analysis, which can be accessed [here.](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas)


This was then visualized by plotting the values in a choropleth map of Maryland, which was obtained from the Maryland opendata API and can be accessed [here.](https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Boundaries/MD_PhysicalBoundaries/FeatureServer/1/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson)
